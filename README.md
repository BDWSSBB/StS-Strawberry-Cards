# Strawberry Cards
Slay the Spire mod that adds new cards.

## Overview
Strawberry Cards is a mod that adds new cards for the vanilla characters, plus a few colorless cards and curses. There are about 15 cards for each character, a rather sizable amount. These cards reuse basic concepts and a bit more, hence the name Strawberry Cards. Nothing is too deviant from the base game, so understanding this mod should be easy.

This mod requires BaseMod and StSLib to work.

## Gameplay Notes
1. This mod also removes Prepared from Silent's card pool in place of Side Swipe. Side Swipe is an Attack that is basically Prepared, but it also deals 4 damage. I did this because I think Prepared sucks as it is, so this is basically a buff.
2. You'll notice some of the cards have special upgrade names. This is solely cosmetic and for fun. I'll eventually add a config to toggle upgrade names.
3. If you find a bug or want to give feedback or something, ping me in the StS Discord Server in #unsupported-modding. If uni life isn't killing me at the moment, I'll get to you.

## Known Issues
* Hot Shot doesn't update shivs in the draw and discard pile. Technically this has always existed with the Accuracy power and is not my fault, but I can do something about it for sure.
* Teyered is misleading with when it applies the No Draw debuff.

## Other Notes
1. I do not own any of the images, clearly. All I did was use Google Images and crop stuff. Hopefully you don't mind my awful selection of art.
2. I'm really stupid, so please don't use my mod as a model. Doing that will probably screw your mod up or something bad like that. Go look at other mods for that.
3. I will not create crossover content (yet). Remember, I'm stupid. I don't want to be overwhelmed with that. This mod isn't really meant for crossover content anyway.

## Extra Important Note (Please Read This)
Strawberry Cards is the first mod I've made for StS (and the first mod in my life). This mod is the first of the Strawberry Spire series, the next mod in line being Strawberry Relics. Strawberry Relics will be merged into Strawberry Cards, so once I'm done with that mod, I'll rename the mod and other chaotic stuff. Basically this means IDs, file names, and stuff may change. I'll try not to break too many things, but no promises.

Okay, you're done reading this. Have fun with the mod, and see if you can find any references within the card name and images, because some of them are indeed references.
