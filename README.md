# Strawberry Spire
Slay the Spire mod that adds new content.

## Overview
Strawberry Spire is a mod that adds new content for the vanilla characters, plus a few things for everyone. Everything reuses basic concepts and a bit more, hence the name Strawberry Spire. Nothing is too deviant from the base game, so understanding this mod should be easy.

This mod requires BaseMod and StSLib to work.

## Gameplay Notes
1. This mod also removes Prepared from Silent's card pool in place of Side Swipe. Side Swipe is an Attack that is basically Prepared, but it also deals 4 damage. I did this because I think Prepared sucks as it is, so this is basically a buff.
2. You'll notice some of the cards have special upgrade names. This is solely cosmetic and for fun. I'll eventually add a config to toggle upgrade names.
3. If you find a bug or want to give feedback or something, ping me in the StS Discord Server in #unsupported-modding. If uni life isn't killing me at the moment, I'll get to you.

## Known Issues
* The Infuse button is in an awkward place. That spot is just temporary; I'll have better logic for knowing where the button should be.
* Bad things happen sometimes since the rock textures are missing outline files. I will fix this ASAP.

## Other Notes
1. I do not own any of the images, clearly. All I did was use Google Images and crop stuff. Hopefully you don't mind my awful selection of art.
2. I'm really stupid, so please don't use my mod as a model. Doing that will probably screw your mod up or something bad like that. Go look at other mods for that.
3. I will not create crossover content (yet). Remember, I'm stupid. I don't want to be overwhelmed with that.

## Kinda-An-Important-Note (This one's small, I promise)
I may be doing some refactoring with some of the stuff here. Shouldn't break too much, just a warning though in case something does blow up. I still need a good method for replacing those rock relics.
