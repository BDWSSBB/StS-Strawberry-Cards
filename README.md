# Strawberry Spire
Slay the Spire mod that adds new content.

## Overview
Strawberry Spire is a mod that adds new content for the vanilla characters, plus a few things for everyone. Everything reuses basic concepts and a bit more, hence the name Strawberry Spire. Nothing is (or should be) too deviant from the base game, so a vanilla player should easily understand this mod's contents.

This mod requires BaseMod and StSLib to work.

## Gameplay Notes
1. This mod also removes Prepared from Silent's card pool in place of Side Swipe. Side Swipe is an Attack that is basically Prepared, but it also deals 4 damage. I did this because I think Prepared sucks as it is, so this is basically a buff.
2. You'll notice some of the cards have special upgrade names. This is solely cosmetic and for fun. I'll eventually add a config to toggle upgrade names.
3. If you find a bug or want to give feedback or something, ping me in the StS Discord Server in #unsupported-modding. If uni life isn't killing me at the moment, I'll get to you.
4. I absolutely refuse to use StSLib's keywords in my cards despite having the mod as a dependency. You wouldn't be the first once to wonder why I'm not; that's why this note exists. Read the overview again, that should explain it. Disagree with it? It's ultimately my decision, and it's staying this way.

## Other Notes
1. I do not own any of the images, clearly. All I did was use Google Images and crop stuff. Hopefully you don't mind my awful selection of art.
2. I'm really stupid, so please don't use my mod as a model. Doing that will probably screw your mod up or something bad like that. Go look at other mods for that (Okay my stupidity is slowly fading, but still, don't just look at my code).
3. So I thought about crossover content for a while. I probably still won't do it in this mod, but I will definitely try to fix things if my mod crashes with another mod. As for if my content doesn't work with another mod, I'll try, but it's less of a priority than actually crashing the whole thing.

## Still-Dynamic Note (Well idk by this point)
Now that I've got most of the stuff I wanted out in this mod, expect updates to slow down. I am now moving onto a character mod (probably after a little break).
